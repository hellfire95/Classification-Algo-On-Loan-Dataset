# ML Classifications Algorithms Implementation

---

ML model for Loan applicatoins. 
This repository contains 4 different Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation.

 
Following are the algorithms:
- k-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

- Jaccard Index
- F1- Score
- Logloss


## About Dataset


Historical data for Loan applications. Has customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted.

| Fields |	Description |
| --- | --- |
Loan_status |	Whether a loan is paid off on in collection
Principal |	Basic principal loan amount at the
Terms |	Origination terms which can be weekly (7 days), biweekly, and monthly payoff schedule
Effective_date |	When the loan got originated and took effects
Due_date |	Since itâ€™s one-time payoff schedule, each loan has one single due date
Age |	Age of applicant
Education |	Education of applicant
Gender |	The gender of applicant
